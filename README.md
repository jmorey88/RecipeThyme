*RecipeThyme Create Form*

#### Image Upload:
Efficient and secure image uploads are crucial for RecipeThyme. The app ensures all images meet size and type criteria before storing them on AWS S3. Images must be under 5MB and in JPEG or PNG format for optimal storage and display.

![RecipeThyme Screenshot](https://recipe-thyme-content.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/screenShots/recipeDetailPage.png)
*RecipeThyme Recipe detail page with image upload*

- **Size Check:** Ensures images are not larger than 5MB to optimize storage and loading speeds.
- **Type Validation:** Accepts only JPEG and PNG formats to maintain consistency and reliability in image displays.
- **AWS S3 Integration:** Uses AWS S3 for robust and scalable image storage. Each image is stored with a unique identifier to prevent conflicts and ensure accessibility.

```ruby
# Extract from the upload_image action in RecipesController

# Validate image size
if uploaded_image.size > 5.megabytes
  render json: { errors: 'Image size should be less than 5MB' }, status: :unprocessable_entity
end

# Check if the image content type is valid
valid_content_types = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png']
unless valid_content_types.include?(uploaded_image.content_type)
  render json: { errors: 'Invalid image type' }, status: :unprocessable_entity
end

# Upload to AWS S3 and update the recipe image URL
s3_resource = Aws::S3::Resource.new(region: ENV['AWS_REGION'])
obj = s3_resource.bucket('recipe-thyme-content').object("recipes/#{SecureRandom.uuid}")
obj.upload_file(uploaded_image.tempfile)
@recipe.update(image: obj.public_url)

render json: { message: 'Image uploaded successfully', image_url: @recipe.image }, status: :ok
```

### Gallery

#### Pagination:
Pagination in RecipeThyme enhances the user experience by allowing users to browse through large sets of recipes without overwhelming load times or clutter. This functionality is managed through coordinated efforts between the frontend and backend.

***Frontend***:
On the frontend, the RecipeGallery component uses InfiniteScroll from react-infinite-scroll-component to load more recipes as the user scrolls down. The component fetches the next page of recipes only if there are more pages to load, which is determined by the state tracked in Redux.

```jsx
// Handling pagination in React with Infinite Scroll
<InfiniteScroll
  dataLength={searchResults?.length || 0}
  next={fetchMoreData}
  hasMore={currentPage < totalPages}
  loader={<h4>Loading...</h4>}
  endMessage={<p className={styles.endMessage}><b>End of Recipes List</b></p>}
>
  <ul className={styles.recipesDisplay}>{renderRecipes()}</ul>
</InfiniteScroll>
```

This snippet demonstrates how the InfiniteScroll component is integrated to handle fetching additional pages based on user scroll, enhancing the browsing experience by loading data on demand.

***Backend:***
The backend complements this by providing the necessary pagination metadata such as current_page and total_pages, which are essential for the frontend to determine whether more recipes are available for fetching.

```jsx
def index
    page_size = params.fetch(:page_size, 20).to_i
    page_number = [params.fetch(:page, 1).to_i, 1].max
    offset = (page_number - 1) * page_size
    recipes_query = Recipe.includes(:author).order(updated_at: :desc)

    # Apply filters...

    @total_entries = recipes_query.count
    @total_pages = (@total_entries.to_f / page_size).ceil
    @current_page = page_number

    @recipes = recipes_query.limit(page_size).offset(offset)
    render json: { recipes: @recipes, meta: { total_pages: @total_pages, current_page: @current_page } }
end
```

This backend logic sets up the pagination by calculating the total number of pages and the current page based on the request parameters. It sends this metadata along with the recipe data to the frontend, which uses it to manage the infinite scrolling behavior.

### Search Feature

#### SQL Query Optimization:
The search functionality in RecipeThyme lets users navigate a vast recipe collection using filters like keywords, tags, and toggles for personal or community recipes. Below is a key SQL query snippet from the Recipes controller's index action that manages this feature.

![RecipeThyme Screenshot](https://recipe-thyme-content.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/screenShots/recipeSearchForm.png)
*RecipeThyme Search Form*

The search mechanism is flexible and efficient, allowing keyword searches across multiple recipe attributes (title, description, ingredients) and filtering by tags. Users can toggle between viewing their own recipes and the entire community's recipes, adding a layer of user-specific customization.

Here's a breakdown of the SQL logic used:

***Keyword***: Search The query supports a case-insensitive search across the recipe's title, description, and ingredients. It uses PostgreSQL's ILIKE for case-insensitive matching.
***Tag Filtering***: Users can filter recipes based on multiple tags. The system returns recipes that match all selected tags, not just any tag.
***User-Specific Recipes***: There's an option to filter the recipes to show only those created by the logged-in user, enhancing personalization.

```ruby
# Extract from the index action in RecipesController

def index
    # Pagination setup
    page_size = params.fetch(:page_size, 20).to_i
    page_number = [params.fetch(:page, 1).to_i, 1].max
    offset = (page_number - 1) * page_size

    # Search and filter setup
    keyword = params[:keyword]
    tag_ids = params[:tag_ids]&.split(',')
    own_recipes = params[:ownRecipes] == 'true'
    
    recipes_query = Recipe.includes(:author)

    if keyword.present?
        keyword_condition = "%#{keyword.downcase}%"
        recipes_query = recipes_query.where("LOWER(recipes.title) LIKE :keyword OR LOWER(recipes.description) LIKE :keyword OR LOWER(recipes.ingredients) LIKE :keyword", keyword: keyword_condition)
    end

    if tag_ids.present?
        recipes_query = recipes_query.joins(:taggings).where(taggings: { tag_id: tag_ids }).group('recipes.id').having('COUNT(DISTINCT taggings.tag_id) = ?', tag_ids.count)
    end

    if own_recipes
        recipes_query = recipes_query.where(author_id: current_user.id)
    end

    @total_entries = recipes_query.count.keys.length
    @total_pages = (@total_entries.to_f / page_size).ceil
    @current_page = page_number

    @recipes = recipes_query.order(updated_at: :desc).limit(page_size).offset(offset)
end
```

### Tags and Taggings

#### Associations:
RecipeThyme uses Rails' Active Record associations to manage relationships between recipes, tags, taggings, and users. This setup allows flexible recipe categorization, making it easier for users to organize and search recipes by tags, and fostering community and personalization as users manage their culinary contributions.

***Association Details:***
- **Tag Model:**
   The `Tag` model serves as a connector between recipes and the tags they belong to. It allows a tag to have relationships with multiple recipes through the `Tagging` model.

   ```ruby
   class Tag < ApplicationRecord
     has_many :taggings
     has_many :recipes, through: :taggings
   end
   ```
- **Tagging Model:**
   The `Tagging` model acts as a join table in a many-to-many relationship between tags and recipes.

   ```ruby
   class Tagging < ApplicationRecord
     belongs_to :recipe
     belongs_to :tag
   end
   ```
- **Recipe Model:**
   Each Recipe belongs to a user and can have multiple tags through the taggings intermediary.

   ```ruby
   class Recipe < ApplicationRecord
     belongs_to :author, class_name: 'User', foreign_key: 'author_id'
     has_many :taggings, dependent: :destroy
     has_many :tags, through: :taggings
   end
   ```
- **User Model:**
   The `User` model illustrates ownership over recipes. Each user can have multiple recipes.

   ```ruby
   class User < ApplicationRecord
     has_many :recipes, foreign_key: 'author_id'
   end
   ```

**Explanation:**

These model associations create a robust framework for RecipeThyme's functionality:

The associations in RecipeThyme facilitate efficient data management and user interactions. Tags enhance recipe discoverability, while taggings allow for flexible categorization. The User model defines recipe ownership, supporting personalized galleries. This robust architecture ensures streamlined operations and enhances the user experience with easy categorization and personalization.

### State Management with Redux
Redux is pivotal in RecipeThyme for managing the application state across different components and features. Below are key insights into how Redux enhances the application:

#### Global State Structure:
The Redux store is organized into major slices to handle different aspects of the application:
- **Session:** Manages user authentication and session data.
- **Recipes:** Stores recipe details and handles CRUD operations state.
- **Search:** Manages the state related to search queries and results.

#### Store Details:
Here's a simplified example of how the Redux store is configured:

```js
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import sessionReducer from './features/session/sessionSlice';
import recipesReducer from './features/recipes/recipeSlice';
import searchReducer from './features/search/searchSlice';

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    session: sessionReducer,
    recipes: recipesReducer,
    search: searchReducer,
  },
});
```

This setup enables efficient data management and ensures that the UI components are always in sync with the backend, providing a seamless user experience.

### Data Generation

RecipeThyme utilizes advanced data generation tasks that incorporate the ChatGPT API to automatically generate comprehensive and diverse recipe data. This includes generating images and recipe details that are stored in userSeedData.json and recipeSeedData.json, respectively. These tasks simplify the process of populating the database with rich content, demonstrating the integration of AI tools in web development.

**Chat GPT API Use:**

The `send_prompt_to_gpt` function plays a crucial role in interfacing with the OpenAI API, sending prompts and receiving generated content that forms the basis of the recipes.

```ruby
# Communicate with OpenAI's GPT to generate recipe data
def send_prompt_to_gpt(prompt)
  uri = URI.parse("https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions")
  request = Net::HTTP::Post.new(uri)
  request.content_type = "application/json"
  request["Authorization"] = "Bearer #{ENV['OPENAI_API_KEY']}"
  request.body = JSON.dump({
    "model" => "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "messages" => [
      { "role" => "system", "content" => "You are a helpful assistant." },
      { "role" => "user", "content" => prompt }
    ]
  })

  response = Net::HTTP.start(uri.hostname, uri.port, use_ssl: uri.scheme == "https") do |http|
    http.request(request)
  end

  response_body = JSON.parse(response.body)
  response_body["choices"].first["message"]["content"].strip unless response_body["error"] || response_body["choices"].empty?
end
```
- #### URI Parsing and Request Setup:
    This snippet constructs an HTTP POST request, specifying the OpenAI API endpoint and including necessary headers such as the content type and authorization token.

- #### JSON Payload:
  It sends a structured JSON body containing the model details and the user prompt, which guides the type of content to be generated.

- #### HTTP Request Execution:
  The function executes the request using Ruby's Net::HTTP library and handles the response.

- #### Response Handling:
  It processes the API's JSON response to extract and return the generated content, ensuring the application can utilize it immediately, for example, to populate a database or provide interactive content to users.

This function is integral to RecipeThyme's backend, allowing it to dynamically generate rich, varied recipe content.

## Hosting/Deployment

This application is hosted on Heroku, which involves setting up environment variables, configuring databases, and ensuring that the production build of the frontend is served correctly. 

## Future Enhancements
As RecipeThyme continues to evolve, several exciting enhancements are planned to enrich user interaction and accessibility:

- **Rating System**: Users will be able to rate recipes and view average ratings. This feature aims to foster community engagement and help users find popular recipes easily.
- **Comments**: Implementation of a commenting system will allow users to provide feedback, suggestions, and interact more dynamically with recipe creators.
- **Social Sharing**: Integration with social media platforms will enable users to share their favorite recipes with friends and followers, extending the reach of RecipeThyme's culinary community.
